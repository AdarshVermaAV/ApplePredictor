            <h2>How Our Apple Classifier Works</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the documentation for our Apple Classifier! Here’s how it works, step by step:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Understanding the Apple Classifier:</strong><br>
                Our apple classifier is a smart computer program designed to identify different types of apples by looking at their pictures.
                It uses a technology called a "neural network," which is a kind of artificial intelligence that learns from examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. What is a Neural Network?</strong><br>
                Think of a neural network like a very complicated pattern-recognizer. Just like how we learn to recognize apples by looking at many examples,
                the neural network learns to identify apples by being shown many apple images and learning the differences between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. The VGG16 Model:</strong><br>
                We use a specific type of neural network called VGG16. This model was originally trained on a huge collection of images from the internet (known as ImageNet)
                to recognize a wide variety of objects. We then fine-tuned it with a smaller set of apple images to make it better at recognizing different types of apples.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Training the Model:</strong><br>
                Training the model means teaching it how to recognize apple types by showing it many pictures of apples. Each picture is labeled with the type of apple it shows.
                Over time, the model learns what each apple type looks like and gets better at identifying them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. How We Process Your Image:</strong><br>
                When you upload an apple picture, the classifier first resizes the image to a standard size that the model expects. It then adjusts the image so that it’s in the right format for the model to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. Making a Prediction:</strong><br>
                After processing the image, the model looks at it and uses what it has learned to guess which type of apple it is. It then provides a prediction and tells you how confident it is in its guess.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>7. Results:</strong><br>
                Finally, you will see the prediction along with the confidence level, which is a percentage showing how sure the model is about its guess.
            </p>
            <p>
